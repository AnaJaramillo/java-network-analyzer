Java Network Analyzer
=====================

Java Network Analyzer provides a collection of social network analysis
algorithms. These algorithms are implemented on mathematical graphs using the
JGraphT library.

Currently supported are betweenness and closeness centrality calculations. The
underlying graph may be directed, edge-reversed or undirected, and edges may or
may not have weights.
