Java Network Analyzer
=====================

Java Network Analyzer provides a collection of [social network
analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) algorithms.
These algorithms are implemented on mathematical graphs using the
[JGraphT](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht) library.

#### Currently supported
* [Betweenness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality)
* [Closeness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Closeness_centrality)
* [Strahler stream order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strahler_number)
  calculated on mathematical trees.

#### Supported graphs
The underlying graph may be directed, edge-reversed or undirected, and edges may
or may not have weights.
