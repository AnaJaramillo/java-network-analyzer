Java Network Analyzer
=====================

Java Network Analyzer provides a collection of [social network
analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) algorithms.
These algorithms are implemented on mathematical graphs using the
[JGraphT](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht) library.

Currently supported are
[betweenness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality) and
[closeness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Closeness_centrality)
centrality calculations. The underlying graph may be directed, edge-reversed or
undirected, and edges may or may not have weights.
